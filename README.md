# VRRM

This was an attempt to improve on my previous lt-64 virtual machine, which had some strange choices for memory layout. I wanted to streamline the instruction set a little bit and add some infrastucture for a heap. I am not satisfied with the result, but as always it offers some learning experience. I might revisit this and try to improve on the heap and the overall memory layout or I might just use it as a learning experience for future work.
